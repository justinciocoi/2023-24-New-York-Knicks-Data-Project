                    <li>A linear regression model was performed and a line of best fit was added to the data</li>
                    <li>While the R squared value is relatively low, a low p-value indicates that there is a statistical significance in this relationship</li>
                    <li>These findings suggest that teams with fewer double digit scorers perform to a higher standard during the NBA regular season</li>
                    <li>Some other factors that could impact this relationship include team chemistry, injury continuity, and age</li>
                    <li>It is important to note that a causal relationship was not found here, but the correlation indicates that this could affect other factors which, in turn, affect team success</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Again, a linear regression was performed and line of best fit added</li>
                    <li>This analysis yielded similar results to the previous one, with low R-squared and p-values</li>
                    <li>This suggests that teams with fewer, but higher volume scorers, may perform better</li>
